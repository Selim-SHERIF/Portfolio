## The Importance of Machine Learning in Modern Engineering

This directory contains projects focused on **Machine Learning** and **AI**, which have become increasingly important in modern engineering. **Machine Learning** is undeniably one of the most significant advancements of this century, driven by its data-hungry approach and ability to solve complex problems. As more investments pour into this domain, its potential continues to grow steadily, influencing the way we approach the scientific method and decision-making.

For engineers, staying current with **Machine Learning** trends is essential. **ML** is reshaping the techniques and methods used in engineering, offering new ways to optimize processes and enhance the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, it is important to remain sharp and effectively utilize **ML** to stay at the forefront of engineering and remain relevant in the field. This is why I dedicate a portion of my time to exploring how this field is evolving. Below are a few applied examples showcasing my work in **Machine Learning**.

### Brief Project Summaries

- **[Predicting_Cardiovascular_Disease_Using_Logistic_Regression](./Predicting_Cardiovascular_Disease_Using_Logistic_Regression)**: This project uses **logistic regression** to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on various health indicators. The model was built from scratch using only Python and the **NumPy** library.

- **[Tweet_Sentiment_Analysis_using_BERT](./Tweet_Sentiment_Analysis_(BERT))**: This project applies the **BERT** model (in contrast to shallow models) to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. It analyzes tweet content and categorizes sentiment as either positive or negative.
