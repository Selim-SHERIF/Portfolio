## Project Descriptions üåê

### **1. User Thermal Preference Prediction**
This project predicts building occupants' thermal preferences to enhance indoor environmental comfort and energy efficiency. A major focus was on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand relationships within the data and identify key factors influencing thermal comfort. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, season, air temperature, and relative humidity.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized relationships between features and thermal preferences.
  - Discovered that air temperature had the most significant impact on thermal preference.
- **Model Development:**
  - Logistic Regression: Used for interpretable classification of preferences into "cooler," "warmer," or "no change."
  - Random Forest: Outperformed logistic regression in terms of accuracy.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Highlighted air temperature and gender as key factors influencing thermal preferences.

### **2. Binary Crack Detection Using ResNet-50**
This project utilizes a ResNet-50 model to classify images of concrete surfaces as "cracked" or "not cracked."

**Key Tasks:**
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied strategies like random flips, rotations, and transformations to improve model robustness.
- **Model Training:**
  - Used PyTorch to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-50 model.
  - Implemented hyperparameter tuning for learning rates and regularization parameters.
- **Evaluation and Insights:**
  - Compared the effects of different learning rates and epochs on model accuracy.
  - Explored the impact of augmentation strategies and regularization in mitigating overfitting.

### **3. Electricity Demand Forecasting for Los Angeles**
This project forecasts electricity demand in Los Angeles for the week ahead using historical data on electricity usage, temperature, and temporal features.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Investigated correlations between electricity demand, temperature, and temporal variables (weekends, holidays).
  - Noted a U-shaped relationship between demand and temperature.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Categorical variables were one-hot encoded.
  - Created a "season" feature to capture climatic trends.
- **Model Development and Comparison:**
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks):** Captured temporal patterns.
  - **Prophet:** Time series forecasting.
  - **XGBoost:** Gradient boosting for feature-driven prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared performance using RMSE and CVRMSE.
