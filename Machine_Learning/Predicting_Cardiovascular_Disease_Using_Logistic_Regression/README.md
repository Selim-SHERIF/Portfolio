## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a binary classification model to predict coronary heart disease susceptibility. It involves detailed data analysis, feature engineering, and model optimization to achieve high prediction accuracy.

### Key Steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Addressed missing values, normalized continuous features, and encoded categorical variables.
- **Feature Selection**: Applied variance thresholds and mean-difference filtering to retain only the most relevant features.
- **Model Development**: Built and optimized a logistic regression model using gradient descent with regularization.

## Repository Contents

### Scripts and Files

- **`run.py`**: Main script to generate predictions and save them in `y_test.csv`.
- **`implementations.py`**: Contains core model functions used in `run.py`.
- **`functions.py`**: Supplementary utility functions.
- **`y_test.csv`**: Output file with predictions generated by the model.
- **`types.csv`**: CSV file summarizing feature filtering:
	- Row 1: Feature names.
	- Row 2: Feature types (1: continuous, 2: categorical, 3: ordinal).
	- Row 3: Binary indicators (1: kept, 0: removed).
- **`Dataset.zip`**: Compressed dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **`Predicting_Cardiovascular_Diseases_Using_Logistic_Regression.pdf`**: Comprehensive project report detailing methods, implementation, and results.

### Feature Selection

- **Variance Thresholding**: Removed low-variance features to reduce redundancy.
- **Mean-Difference Filtering**: Eliminated features with minimal discriminatory power.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified and removed highly interdependent features.

## Results

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
	- **F1 Score**: 0.439 (balanced precision and recall for imbalanced data).
	- **Accuracy**: 0.875 (overall effectiveness of predictions).

These metrics were evaluated through the AI Crowd competition platform, where the team ranked **42nd out of 320 submissions**.
