# Particle Deposition Prediction Around a 90-Degree Bend  üåä

### Context:

## 3 Key Takeaways üìä
1. **Turbulence Modeling Matters**: The choice of turbulence models (e.g., k-Œµ, RANS/LES) significantly impacts deposition accuracy.  
2. **Particle Deposition Behavior**: Deposition efficiency follows an **S-shaped (logistic-like) curve** with particle size.  
3. **Open-Source Trade-off**: Open-source CFD tools offer **greater customizability** but are **more complex to set up and run**.

## Overview
This project simulates **particle-laden flow** through a **90¬∞ pipe bend** using **T-Flows CFD**. It aims to:
- Predict particle deposition patterns.
- Investigate how particle sizes affect deposition.
- Validate results against existing benchmarks.

Insights from this study aim to optimize industrial systems featuring curved geometries (e.g., ducts, exhaust lines), where secondary flows and swirling significantly influence particle trajectories.
