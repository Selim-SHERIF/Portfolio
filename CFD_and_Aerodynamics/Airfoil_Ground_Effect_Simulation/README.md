## The 3 Key Takeaways üìä
- **Automated Simulation Workflows:** Automating simulation processes can be highly beneficial, streamlining tasks and reducing manual errors.
- **FLUENT as a Black Box:** While Ansys produces reliable outputs, it operates as a ‚Äúblack box,‚Äù meaning the underlying processes and computations remain hidden.
- **Ground Effect on Lift:** The lift increase due to ground effect is minimal for typical aircraft wings; noticeable differences only occur when the aircraft is extremely close to the ground.

## Project Objectives

1. Analyze how ground proximity influences aerodynamic characteristics such as lift and drag.
2. Evaluate the effects of different height-to-chord ratios ($h/c$) and angles of attack ($\alpha = 4^\circ$ and $\alpha = 6^\circ$).
3. Validate numerical results against experimental and theoretical data.

## Approach and Methodology

1. **Geometry and Computational Domain:**
    - Modeled the NACA 4417 airfoil with a chord length of 1 meter.
    - Investigated height-to-chord ratios ($h/c$) ranging from 0.1 to 1.0.

2. **Physical and Numerical Modeling:**
    - Assumed incompressible, isothermal, and Newtonian fluid behavior.
    - Applied the $k-\omega$ turbulence model for resolving near-wall effects.
    - Simulations conducted using steady-state conditions in ANSYS Fluent.

3. **Mesh Design and Convergence Study:**
    - Hybrid meshing approach: structured grids for uniform flow regions and unstructured grids near the airfoil for resolving gradients.
    - Convergence study with six progressively refined meshes to ensure accuracy.

## Results and Insights

1. **Aerodynamic Characteristics:**
    - Lift coefficient ($C_L$) increased as $h/c$ decreased, emphasizing stronger ground effects at lower heights.
    - Drag coefficient ($C_D$) decreased near the ground, reflecting improved aerodynamic efficiency.

2. **Flow Field Analysis:**
    - Pressure contours revealed significant pressure differentials between the airfoil surfaces.
    - Velocity contours highlighted accelerated flow over the upper surface and wake structures downstream.

3. **Validation:**
    - The results aligned with experimental studies on similar airfoils, confirming the reliability of the numerical simulations.
