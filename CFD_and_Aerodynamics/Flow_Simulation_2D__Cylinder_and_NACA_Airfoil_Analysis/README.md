### LAB 1: Steady Airflow Around a 2D Airfoil

This lab introduced OpenFOAM and focused on steady-state airflow around a 2D NACA-0012 airfoil. The objective was to understand the step-by-step process of setting up and running a CFD simulation.

**Key Areas of Study:**
- **Case Setup and Parameter Definition:**  
  The lab began by defining simulation parameters, including fluid properties, initial conditions, and boundary conditions. Governing equations and assumptions, such as the incompressibility of airflow, were outlined.

- **Computational Domain and Mesh Generation:**  
  The impact of computational domain size on results was analyzed. Mesh independence tests were performed to ensure accuracy without incurring unnecessary computational costs.

- **Numerical Schemes and Solver Settings:**  
  Various numerical schemes were evaluated to determine their effect on simulation results. Solver settings, such as relaxation factors, were fine-tuned for improved convergence and stability.

- **Aerodynamic Performance Analysis:**  
  Lift and drag coefficients were calculated for different angles of attack. The results were validated against theoretical and experimental data to assess the simulation's accuracy.

Building on the first lab, this lab focused on transient simulations of unsteady airflow around a 2D cylinder. The scenario modeled conditions similar to airflow around a moving truck's exhaust pipe.

**Key Areas of Study:**
- **Case Setup and Parameters:**  
  Detailed setup included defining transient conditions and selecting appropriate solvers. Governing equations for unsteady flow and assumptions about turbulence modeling were incorporated.

- **Effect of CFL Number and Time Step:**  
  The influence of CFL number and time step on stability and accuracy was studied, alongside computational time considerations.

- **Turbulence Modeling and Wall Treatments:**  
  Different turbulence models, such as the Spalart-Allmaras and k-œâ SST models, were compared. Wall-modeled and wall-resolved approaches were tested to analyze their effects on cylinder surface properties.

- **Wake and Flow Analysis:**  
  The cylinder's wake behavior was examined, including lift and drag fluctuations. The Strouhal number was calculated to characterize vortex shedding and its dependency on Reynolds number and cylinder dimensions.

Both labs were compiled into comprehensive reports shared in this repository. While the original simulation files are unavailable, the results are reproducible using the provided documentation.
